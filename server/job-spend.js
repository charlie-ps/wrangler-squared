// What a job cost, for the Jobs board. Pure over a usage scan (usage-report.js
// scanAllDaily) plus a jobs snapshot: the expensive half stays in the scanner, and
// this module only ever SUMS dollars it was handed — never a fourth token-pricing
// scanner beside transcript-reader / usage-report / cost-report.mjs.
//
// Why the scan rather than graph.sessions, which already carries a per-card `usd`:
// a job step is archived the instant it stops (job-runtime retire) and an archived
// entry is transcript-free by design, while a headless comment triage has no card
// of its own and is billed onto the sub-job's latest card as a priorLiveSessionId —
// which the live enrichment never reads. scanAllDaily resolves every transcript a
// card has owned (priorLiveSessionIds included), applies the fork bound and
// estimates Codex, so it is the only source that sees a finished job's whole bill.

// cardId -> { usd, estimated }. Two rows can share a card (a `/clear` leaves an
// earlier transcript behind, and each is its own row), so they accumulate. A row's
// `estimatedUsd` is a dollar SLICE, not a flag: any of it means the card's total
// carries a Codex estimate and must be shown with `~`.

// Zero reads as "nothing attributable yet" and is carried as null, so a backlog
// job renders nothing rather than advertising $0.00 — the board hides a null.
