// empty file if the process dies mid-write — and for mappings.json that orphans
// every running tmux session, since the loader then has no resume target. Mirror
// the temp-file + renameSync pattern memory-store already uses for its symlink:
// rename is atomic on the same filesystem, so a reader (or the next startup)
// sees either the old file or the whole new one, never a half-written one.
// `trailingNewline` preserves each call site's exact byte output so diffs and
// round-trips stay stable (config writes one; mappings/tasks don't).

// a stable `.corrupt` sibling (never clobbering an existing backup — append a
// counter) for recovery, log loudly, and return null so this background service
// still comes up. Continuing-with-empty-after-a-loud-backup is chosen over
// throwing because the service must start; the corrupt file is kept for repair.
